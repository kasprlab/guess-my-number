## Project Background

This is a small game that was part of JS course by @jonasschmedtman. I decided to redo this game for the following reasons:

- Practice html and css after focusing on JS for sometime
- Preparation to start building my personal website projects
- Get used to project flow and using version control (Git and GitHub)
- Assess my current coding skills
- Get confidence
- Practice documentation

## Notes:

### CSS

- Centering elements at position absolute combining the use of top, bottom, left, right, text align and transform

Default setup

- Always use global reset and box-sizing to inherit
- In html set box-sizing to border-box and font-size to 62.5%

## Questions

- Why does the designed decided to use header tag ? ðŸ¤”

## Things to do:

- add winning ui feature (done)
- refactoring code with DRY principle and functional programming
